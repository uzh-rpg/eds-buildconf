   ## Rock-ROS bridge
   # You will also have to uncomment the 'rock.ros' line in the layout below
   #- github: rock-ros/package_set

# Layout. Note that the rock.base and orocos.toolchain sets are
# imported by other rock sets.
layout:
   - rock.core
   - rock.vscode
   - rock.vscode.gems
   - perception/orogen/apriltags
   - drivers/orogen/camera_davis
   - drivers/orogen/camera_prophesee
   - drivers/orogen/dual_setup
   - eds/orogen/eds_deployments
   - slam/orogen/dso
   - slam/orogen/eds
   - bundles/eds
   # Uncomment to enable the Rock/ROS bridge
   # You will also have to uncomment some lines in the package_sets above
   #- rock.ros
   # Uncomment to checkout and build all tutorials  
   # - rock.tutorials    

# The layout section specifies what to build, and where to build it (as a
# subdirectory of the root installation directory). In the example below, all
# the packages of the rock.toolchain package set will be built, in the tools/
# subdirectory: source in tools/typelib, tools/orocos/rtt, ... and installed
# files in build/tools/typelib, build/tools/orocos/rtt, ...
#
# layout:
#   - tools:
#     - rock.toolchain
#
# Single packages can also be selected instead of whole package sets. The
# package names are interpreted as a regular expression, so it is possible to
# do:
#
# layout:
#   - tools:
#     - typelib
#     - utilmm
#     - orocos/
#
# The first two match the typelib and utilmm packages, while the second one
# match all packages in which "orocos/" is found.
#
# Again, note that if a layout section is present, only the packages listed
# there will be built.

# Package exclusion: packages can be completely excluded from the build. This is
# an alternative way than using the layout, mainly useful if you want to enable
# all packages but a few ones. As with layout, the names are actually regular
# expressions.
#
# exclude_packages:
#   - orocos/

# Ignoring packages: same principle than package exclusion, but this time the
# packages are considered to be installed and up-to-date. This is useful if you
# want to use an already installed software package.
#
# For instance, let's assume the orocos/rtt is already installed on your
# machine. You would then simply do:
#
ignored_packages:
   - tools/pocolog2msgpack
