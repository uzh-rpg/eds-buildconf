# Additionally, you can set up your own custom environment with calls to env_add

# env_add 'PATH', "/path/to/my/tool"
# env_set 'CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH', "/opt/boost;/opt/xerces"
# env_set 'CMAKE_INSTALL_PATH', "/opt/orocos"

# NOTE: Variables set like this are exported in the generated 'env.sh' script.
